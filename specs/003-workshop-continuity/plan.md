# Implementation plan

Use scoped journey view models for additive query navigation: workshop/page, assessment test, coding lab, returnTo and workshopName. Each remote remains independently deployable; no nested remotes or new shared package. Validate returnTo against /workshops/overview with only workshop/page parameters. Keep existing API clients and singleton stores.

Workshop presentation adopts existing lab/assessment hero and theme foundations, an ordered contents rail and next activity. Activity pages display a consistent return banner, filter exact resources, preserve context across existing views and never auto-start a write. Restore workshops after catalog load, fetch the selected lesson and reconcile progress on return.

Constitution: MVVM, OnPush, inline BEM, theme tokens, lifetime cleanup and federation interfaces preserved. Existing large App/workshop composition components remain cohesive composition exceptions; reader responsibilities split into activity outline. Verify meaningful navigation/restore regressions, existing failure/save suites, architecture guards, types and isolated production builds. Hosted auth/gateway walkthrough is separate integration evidence.
